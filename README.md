## Description

**The Plot Hole** is a personal media library app that lets users track movies, TV shows, and books. Users can add items to their library, record notes, assign a rating, and mark the status of each item. The app features session-based authentication, so each user can only manage their own media library.

I built this app to practice full-stack development with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS templates while implementing authentication, authorization, and CRUD functionality.
